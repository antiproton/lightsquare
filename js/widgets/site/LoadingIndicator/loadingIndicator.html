				<h1>Connection problem</h1>
				<h3>It's taking longer than usual to establish a connection to the server.</h3>
				<p>
					If reloading the page doesn't work, the server has probably crashed and
					will be back online shortly.
				</p>
				<h2>Interrupted games</h2>
				<p>
					Your games are stored locally.  Once the server comes back online, click
					"Restore game" on the homepage (under Tools) to pick up where you left off.
					(Both players need to do this for the game to be restored).
